    <h2>GitHub Introduction</h2>
    <section>
        <p>Initialize Git on a folder, making it a Repository.</p>
        <p>Git now creates a hidden folder to keep track of changes in that folder.</p>
        <p>When a file is changed, added, or deleted, it is considered modified.</p>
        <p>You select the modified files you want to <em>Stage</em>.</p>
        <p>The Staged files are <em>Committed</em>, which prompts Git to store a permanent snapshot of the files.</p>
        <p>Git allows you to see the full history of every commit.</p>
        <p>You can revert back to any previous commit.</p>
        <p>Git does not store a separate copy of every file in every commit, but keeps track of changes made in each commit.</p>

    <h2>AWS Introduction</h2>
    <section>
        <p>In 2006, Amazon Web Services (AWS) began offering IT infrastructure services to businesses as web servicesâ€”now commonly known as cloud computing.</p>

        <p>With the cloud, businesses no longer need to plan for and procure servers and other IT infrastructure weeks or months in advance.</p>
        <p>Instead, they can instantly spin up hundreds or thousands of servers in minutes and deliver results faster.</p>
